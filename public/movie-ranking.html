<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Forest Gump</h3>
<p>Forest Gump is my favorite movie of all times. I specially like this movie because it tells a lot about values, motivation, ethics, success and what really matters in life. Also, I like the quotes, like the one of life beeing a box of chocolats.</p>

<h3>The big fish</h3>
<p>I liked the movie and message it transmitts regarding what is true and false and when or whether that is important.</p>

<h3>Django Unchained</h3>
<p>A great movie, with great scenes, high quality dialogues and soundtrack.</p>
